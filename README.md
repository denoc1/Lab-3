# Lab-3
Practice variables and output

-	Create a comment header as before, with your **name, description, and date**.
-	Create an **integer value** called “studentID” and set it to a random (you create it) 6 digit number.
-	Create an **integer variable** called “age” and set it to a reasonable number
-	Create a **decimal** (double) variable called “amountDue” and initialize it a reasonable value.
-	Finally, **print out in one line** “The student (output their ID# here) is (their age here) years old and owes (put money amount here).”  (Note the period at the end of the sentence!)


For example, the output might look like:

        The student 241534 is 18 years old and owes $14.36.
